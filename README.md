## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
We propose a multilingual, AI-powered crop advisory platform (mobile app + chatbot) tailored for small and marginal farmers. The platform provides real-time, hyper-local guidance by combining weather data, soil reports, market prices, and pest/disease recognition. Unlike generic advisories, it adapts to each farmerâ€™s land, crop history, and input constraints. Voice-enabled support in regional languages ensures inclusivity for farmers with low literacy.

How it Addresses the Problem

Replaces guesswork with scientifically validated, personalized advice.

Reduces input misuse (fertilizers, pesticides), cutting costs and protecting the environment.

Provides predictive alerts (e.g., weather, pest outbreaks) to minimize losses.

Strengthens farmer autonomy by reducing dependence on middlemen/shopkeepers.

Innovation and Uniqueness

Hyper-local + multilingual + voice-enabled â€“ a rare combination addressing language and literacy barriers.

AI-driven image-based pest/disease detection using farmersâ€™ own phone cameras.

Offline-first design with SMS/IVR fallback for poor connectivity.

Continuous feedback loop to refine advisories based on user data and field outcomes.
ur proposed solution is a farmer-centric, multilingual smart advisory platform that delivers personalized, real-time, and actionable guidance to small and marginal farmers. Unlike generic apps, this system combines AI + IoT + local knowledge to ensure accuracy, inclusivity, and trust.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features & Description

Multilingual AI Chatbot (Voice + Text + Image):

Supports major Indian languages and dialects.

Farmers can interact through voice commands, text inputs, or image uploads.

Accessible via mobile app, WhatsApp, or IVR calls.

Soil Health Intelligence:

Reads soil health card data or farmer inputs (soil texture, pH, past crops).

Recommends crop rotation, fertilizer type & dosage (reducing input misuse).

Provides organic/natural farming alternatives.

Weather & Climate Smart Advisory:

Uses IMD and satellite data for real-time and predictive weather insights.

Issues alerts for rainfall, drought, or frost, tailored to crop stage.

Suggests irrigation scheduling and risk mitigation strategies.

Pest & Disease Detection (AI Vision):

Farmers upload a photo of affected crop leaves.

AI model identifies disease/pest and suggests treatment.

Prioritizes eco-friendly, cost-effective remedies before chemical sprays.

Market Price & Demand Forecasting:

Integrates with mandi price APIs and nearby buyer networks.

Suggests best time & place to sell to maximize profits.

Tracks demand trends for emerging crops.

Learning & Knowledge Hub:

Video/audio tutorials on modern practices in local languages.

Peer-to-peer farmer discussion forum for trust-building.

Success stories to encourage adoption.

Offline & Low-Tech Accessibility:

Works in low-network areas using SMS/IVR fallback.

Lightweight app with offline caching of advisories.

Voice-based navigation for low-literate farmers.

Feedback & Continuous Learning:

Farmers rate advice (helpful/not helpful).

Field outcomes used to improve models.

Government/NGO officers can upload ground-level insights.

Integration with Govt. Schemes & Subsidies:

Direct link to subsidy eligibility, loan support, and crop insurance schemes.

Push notifications about new government programs.

Farmer Profiling for Personalization:

Each farmer has a digital profile (crop history, soil type, location).

AI engine continuously personalizes recommendations based on evolving data.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility and Viability

Feasibility: Uses existing government data (soil, weather, mandi prices) + open-source AI models. Mobile-first approach ensures easy adoption.

Challenges: Digital literacy, internet gaps, trust deficit.

Mitigation:

Voice-first interface, IVR fallback.

Training + onboarding via extension workers & NGOs.

Building trust through government branding (Punjab Govt) and farmer champions.
## Impact and Benefits
<Impact and Benefits

Social: Empowers farmers with knowledge in their own language.

Economic: Increases yield by 20â€“30%, reduces unnecessary input costs.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable farming, reduces chemical overuse.

Policy Support: Strengthens government schemes (Soil Health Card, Kisan Call Centers).>
